	 * Consider the following code fragment:

	 * What is the time complexity for this method?
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Select one: a. O(N), N = len b. O(1) c. None of the alternatives since each
	 * list might have different size. d. O(N*M), N = len, and M =

	 * None of the alternatives since each list might have different size.
